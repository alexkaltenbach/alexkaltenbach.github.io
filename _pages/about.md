I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Technical University of Berlin in the group Differential Equations headed by Prof. Dr. Etienne Emmrich.
Previously I held a Postdoc position the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Freiburg, where I also did my PhD under
the supervision of Prof. Dr. Michael Růžička. From July 2023 to April 2024 I have been Fellow of the Walter-Benjamin-Program. 
My research project, which I conducted in collaboration with Prof. Dr. Luigi C. Berselli at the University of Pisa,
aimed at theoretical and experimental investigation on numerical methods for so-called smart fluids.
 
Research interests
======
1. **Error analysis for non-smooth, convex minimization problems on the basis of convex duality**
  - *A priori* error analysis on the basis of discrete convex duality
  (especially *a priori* error identities);
  - *A posteriori* error analysis on the basis of continuous convex duality 
  (especially *a posteriori* error identities);
  - *Medius* error analysis (*i.e.*, best-approximation results);
  - Reconstruction formulas for (discrete) dual solutions from (discrete) primal solutions (and vice versa);
  (so-called generalized Marini formulas);
  - Adaptive mesh refinement by means of resulting local refinement indicators;
  - Iterative methods for non-smooth, convex minimizatioin problems (*e.g.*, semi-discretized gradient flows, semi-smooth Newton methods, primal-dual iterations);
  - Model problems: $p$-Dirichlet problem, $p(x)$-Dirichlet problem, obstacle problem, Signorini problem, Rudin–Osher–Fatemi problem, 
        elastisch-plastic torsions problem.

2. **Numerical methods for** ***smart fluids***
  - Convergence analysis for finite element approximations for steady and unsteady problems;
  - *A priori* error analysis for finite element approximations for steady and unsteady problems;
  - Existence and regularity theory for steady and unsteady problems;
  - Application-oriented simulations (with applications from the field of engineering). 

3. **Convergence analysis for fully-discretizations of non-linear evolution equations**
  - Convergence results for fully-discretizations without parabolic compactness theorems like Lions-Aubin or Simon, 
    but on the basis of *non-conforming (Bochner) pseudomonotonicity*;
  - *Hirano-Landes approach*, *i.e.*, convergence results for fully-discretizations 
    on the basis of stationary compactness theorems (*e.g.*, Rellich or non-conforming generalizations).

4. **Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) type approximations for non-Newtonian fluids**
  - Convergence analysis for steady and unsteady problems;
  - *A priori* error analysis for steady and unsteady problems;
  - Local Discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) approximations;
  - Symmetric Interior Penalty (SIP) approximations;
  - Quasi-optimality, *i.e.*, best approximation results for irregular right-hand sides
        and without oscillation terms;

5. **Approximation of parametric PDEs with artificial neural networks (ANNs)** 
  - Approximation of high-dimensional parametric PDEs using the Deep Ritz method and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs);
  - Development of a suitable functional analytical framework for high-dimensional parametric PDEs,
    the so-called *parametric Bochner-Lebesgue spaces*;
  - $\Gamma$-convergence and error analyses under minimal regularity assumptions on the data.
