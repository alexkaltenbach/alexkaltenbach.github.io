I am a postdoctoral research associate at the Technical University of Berlin supervised by Prof. Dr. Etienne Emmrich.
I obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Freiburg supervised by Prof. Dr. Michael Růžička. 

My research interests are
=========================
1. Analysis and numerics for non-Newtonian fluids, especially `smart fluids';
2. *A priori* and *a posteriori* error analysis for non-smooth convex minimization problems based on convex duality theory;
3. Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods.
