I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Technical University of Berlin in the research group *Differential Equations* headed by Prof. Dr. Etienne Emmrich.

From March to September 2026, I will be a Distinguished Fellow at George Mason University (Fairfax, VA, USA), hosted by Prof. Dr. Harbir Antil, where I will work on duality-based error control and numerical methods for digital-twin-based structural health monitoring.

Previously, I held a postdoctoral position at the University of Freiburg, where I also completed my PhD under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Michael Růžička. From July 2023 to April 2024, I was a Walter Benjamin Fellow of the German Research Foundation (DFG), conducting research on numerical methods for so-called smart fluids in collaboration with Prof. Dr. Luigi C. Berselli at the University of Pisa.

My research lies at the intersection of numerical analysis, partial differential equations, and convex variational methods. I develop mathematically rigorous and computationally reliable methods for nonlinear and non-smooth problems, with a particular focus on complex fluid models and applications arising in engineering and the natural sciences.
