I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Technical University of Berlin supervised by Prof. Dr. Etienne Emmrich.
I obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Freiburg supervised by Prof. Dr. Michael Růžička. 
From July 2023 to April 2024 I have been Fellow of the Walter-Benjamin-Program.

Research interests
=========================
1. Analysis and numerics for `smart fluids';
2. Convergence analyses for fully-discrete approximations of evolution equations;
3. *A priori* and *a posteriori* error analysis for non-smooth convex minimization problems based on convex duality theory;
4. Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) type approximations for non-Newtonian fluids;
5. Approximation of parametric PDEs using ANNs.
