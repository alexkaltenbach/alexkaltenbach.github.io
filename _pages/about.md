Research interests
=========================
1. Analysis and numerics for `smart fluids';
2. Convergence analyses for fully-discrete approximations of evolution equations;
3. *A priori* and *a posteriori* error analysis for non-smooth convex minimization problems based on convex duality theory;
4. Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) type approximations for non-Newtonian fluids;
5. Approximation of parametric PDEs using ANNs.
